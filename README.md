# Unite Rich Text Helper

This tool gives users an interface to customize their own rich text, for use in Unity games such as Pokemon Unite. 

I used React to let users add and remove pre-defined tags from text in a textbox. When copied in game, this will render the text with special effects, such as different sizes and colors. 

To extend this project, I can tidy up the front-end (image sizing, mobile responsiveness, general design), as well as add a text previewer based on the tags the user selected.
